Disclaimer: I took notes as I watched lessons of Docker from different sources, as well as did some excercises to understand the concepts more. My sources are mainly from:
[UH's Devops with Docker](https://courses.mooc.fi/org/uh-cs/courses/devops-with-docker)
[Complete Docker Course](https://youtu.be/RqTEHSBrYFw?si=TYjvzSpOLZwvGy4y)
